# Disaster-Response-Project

## Project Description
This is a part of Data Science Nanodegree Udacity with data from Figure Eight. The goal is to build a model that can categorize disaster messages so the message can reach the right place at a faster rate.

The deliverable is the web app where users can type the message and get the result right away

## Instructions
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
